Since young, I have played various clicker games like cookie clicker, and have always been curious on how to make it. I came acorss this course on Zenva Academy, Craft a 2D Idle Clicker Game, which guided me in creating my very own idle clicker game.

Developed with Unity and C#, this course has taught me to:

- Harness the potential of Unity's UI system, a must-have skill for any aspiring game developer
- Damage opponents with clicks, adding an interactive layer that keeps players hooked to the experience
- Earn gold upon enemy defeat, making every victory feel rewarding and fueling player progression
- Randomize and cycle images, creating a dynamic visual environment that enhances player engagement
- Implement "auto-clickers" to support idle gameplay, a staple feature within the incremental game genre
- Animate foes when they take damage, providing visual feedback that brings your in-game world to life

Through this short course, I have learnt about various Unity features:

- Unity's UI
- Prefab Variants
- Class Singletons
- Animation
