As someone who absolutely loved playing Restaurant City on Facebook, I was gutted when it shut down back in 2012. This led me to thinking of recreating a much simpler version of it. Chancing upon "Develop a City-Building Game with Unity" Course on Zenva Academy, I was excited to build my own version.

Developed with Unity and C#, this course has taught me to create:

- Camera controller which can rotate, move, and zoom
- Expandable buildings using scriptable objects
- Building placement and bulldozer tool
- UI to connect everything together
- City logic to calculate population, jobs, food and money

Compared to the previous course on the idle clicker game, this course was more challenging. It was more independent, requiring me to figure out how to replicate various prefabs and UI. I also faced issues like the UI bar not fitting on the screen properly and text box not aligning to various screen resolutions, which I had to resolve them myself.
