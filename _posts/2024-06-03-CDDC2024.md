Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions have always intrigued me with their blend of puzzles, coding, and cybersecurity challenges. When I saw the opportunity to participate in DSTA BrainHack 2024, I knew I had to give it a try.

Participating in CDDC 2024, my first-ever CTF, I initially felt quite lost when trying to tackle the problems during the training sessions. However, thanks to the lecture videos provided by DSTA and the support of my friends, I quickly grasped the fundamentals of CTFs and how to approach the challenges.

The challenges covered various areas, including network security, cryptography, web security, Linux, and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). All of the challenges I have completed can be found on my [github writeup](https://github.com/kailermai/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/CDDC2024){:target="\_blank"}.
