Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions have always intrigued me with their blend of puzzles, coding, and cybersecurity challenges. When I saw the opportunity to participate in DSTA BrainHack 2024, I knew I had to give it a try.

Participating in CDDC 2024, my first-ever CTF, I initially felt quite lost when trying to tackle the problems during the training sessions. However, thanks to the lecture videos provided by DSTA and the support of my friends, I quickly grasped the fundamentals of CTFs and how to approach the challenges.

| Categories | Challenges Solved | Points | University Ranking | Overall Ranking|
| -------- | ------------------  |--------|--------------------|----------------|
| Training | 46 /125             | 3590   | 128 / 1105         | 189 / 1923     |
| Qualifiers| 8 /36              | 850    | 106 / 405          | 159 / 712     |


The challenges covered various areas, including network security, cryptography, web security, Linux, and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). All of the challenges I have completed can be found on my [github writeup](https://github.com/kailermai/CTF-Writeups/tree/main/CDDC2024){:target="\_blank"}.
