Being a fan of Bloons Tower Defence, this was a fun project to develop. It is just a simple game with only 2 waves and 2 towers to use, made without the intent of publishing a proper game.

Developed with Unity and C#, this course has taught me to create:

- Tower placement
- Wave spawning system
- Enemy health bars
- Different tower attack types (projectile and explosion animations)

Play it on your [browser!](https://kailermai.github.io/towerDefenceGame/WebBuild/index.html){:target="\_blank"}

The files are available on my [Github Repo](https://github.com/kailermai/towerDefenceGame){:target="\_blank"}!
